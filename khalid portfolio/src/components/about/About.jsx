            <p>
            I am Khalid, I was born in Ramallah in 2000. I specialized in computer systems engineering at the Arab American University, and I completed my major in record time, 4 years instead of 5 years, and now I hope to study artificial intelligence in the next academic year 2022/2023, I like to develop myself and my skills then learn new things. The beginning of the path is a step, but I am now, although I am nearing to the end, but I want to develop until I have reached the highest capabilities. I am currently excellent as a hardware and software student, and I am working on developing myself in the software now. I have completed many courses in order to be a follower of technology, and I am still training and learning from the courses and continue to do more.
